    <p>
        You have a limited time to collect the next part for the Machine, when 12 seconds have passed time rewinds and
        you have to start over. But donâ€™t worry, your past self is still around to repeat your past actions.

    </p>
    <p>
        Controls:<br>
        WASD - move your time ghost<br>
        Space - wait in place for the rest of the duration<br>
        R - clear out existing ghosts. Does not reset The Machine.
